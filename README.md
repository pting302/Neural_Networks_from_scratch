Simple Neural Networks/ Perceptrons
Simple Neural Network/ perceptrons using the Sigmoid Activation function. A Neural Network is a structured amalgamation of input data, output data, and randomly generated weights that become increasingly accurate through the use of back propagation and gradient descent. Its foundation lies on pre existing data to further extrapolate on unfamiliar inputs.
